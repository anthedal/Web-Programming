        <h2>Summer Trip to Portugal</h2>
        <p>Last summer I went to Portugal with my family for a week, where we visited Lisbon, 
            Porto, and Lagos. Each city had its own unique atmosphere and style, which made it fun 
            to explore the areas. We got to learn the history of Lisbon through a walking tour of the 
            city while also taking in the beautiful views. In Porto we went on a wine tour as well as a river cruise
            along the Douro River. Finally, in Lagos we got to relax on the beach and enjoy the different beaches.

        <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <a href="https://www.lafamigliagiorgios.com/index.php" target="_blank">La Famiglia Giorgio's Website Link</a>
        <p>My favorite restaurant is La Famiglia Giorgio's in the North End Boston because they have 
            a very large menu that the majority can be made gluten free. My family loves to go for special occasions like 
            birthdays where I usually get the chicken parm and it is delicious.

        <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
        <img src="yemista.jpg" width = "250" alt="Stuffed Tomatoes">
        <p>Although my favorite restaurant is Italian cuisine, my favorite food is a Greek dish called Yemista (stuffed tomatoes). 
        Yemista is a traditional Greek dish that is tomatoes, peppers, or zucchini stuffed with rice and ground beef with potatoes, cooked in the oven.
        My mom often made this meal for my family and it has always been my favorite meal since I was young. </p>
